# Skrif Development Log: Day 1 (May 9, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Registered skrif.org: Completed (via Namecheap)
- Secured @skriflang handles: Completed (X.com, Dev.to, Discord, Reddit, YouTube)
- Created Discord server: Completed (https://discord.gg/ctPxDGeB)
- Installed tools: Completed (Python 3.13.3, SLY 0.5, Git 2.49.0, VS Code 1.100.0)
- Created GitHub repo (github.com/skriflang/skrif) with README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, and folder structure.
- Documented progress in this log.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Failed to navigate to ~/Projects (directory didn’t exist). Created it with `mkdir ~/Projects` and retried `cd ~/Projects`.
- Failed to create directories with `mkdir src docs docs/daily-log` in PowerShell due to argument error. Fixed by running `mkdir src`, `mkdir docs`, `mkdir docs\daily-log` separately.
- Initially used "skrif" in LICENSE copyright notice; updated to "skriflang" to align with GitHub organization (skriflang). Renamed file from `license` to `LICENSE`.
- Git commit failed due to missing user identity. Fixed by running `git config --global user.name "Jan Strydom"` and `git config --global user.email "skrif.org@gmail.com"`.
- Failed to add `docs/daily-log/day-1.md` because the file was missing. Created it in `docs\daily-log` using VS Code.
- SSH key generation failed due to invalid file path input. Regenerated key with default path and added to GitHub.
- SSH agent setup failed due to missing `Start-SshAgent`. Fixed by running PowerShell as administrator and enabling OpenSSH agent with `Start-Service ssh-agent`.
- Standardized on lowercase "skriflang" for GitHub username, social handles (@skriflang), and documentation to align with platform restrictions and branding strategy, with "skrif" as the language name (like Python, Ruby).

## Key Outputs
- Domain: skrif.org
- Social Handles: @skriflang on X.com, Dev.to, Discord, Reddit, YouTube
- Discord: https://discord.gg/ctPxDGeB
- GitHub: [github.com/skriflang/skrif](https://github.com/skriflang/skrif)
- Installed: Python 3.13.3, SLY 0.5, Git 2.49.0, VS Code 1.100.0

## Alignment with Skrif’s Vision
Today’s tasks established skrif’s foundation, setting up the repo, branding, and community channels to build a human-readable, versatile language to outshine Python by 2030. The Discord server, MIT License (under skriflang), SSH authentication, and lowercase skriflang branding (with skrif as the language name) lay the groundwork for collaboration and monetization.

## Time Spent
~3-3.5 hours (due to PowerShell directory issues, Git configuration, SSH setup, and file creation)
