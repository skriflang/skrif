# Skrif Development Log: Day 1 (May 9, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Registered skrif.org: [Completed/Pending, note domain or alternative]
- Secured @Skrif handles: [List platforms or "Pending"]
- Created Discord server: Completed (https://discord.gg/ctPxDGeB)
- Installed tools: [List Python version, SLY/Lark, Git, VS Code, or "Pending"]
- Created GitHub repo (github.com/SkrifLang/skrif) with README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, and folder structure.
- Documented progress in this log.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Failed to navigate to ~/Projects (directory didn’t exist). Created it with `mkdir ~/Projects` and retried `cd ~/Projects`.
- Failed to create directories with `mkdir src docs docs/daily-log` in PowerShell due to argument error. Fixed by running `mkdir src`, `mkdir docs`, `mkdir docs\daily-log` separately.
- Used "SkrifLang" in LICENSE copyright notice to align with GitHub organization and strengthen branding.
- Git commit failed due to missing user identity. Fixed by running `git config --global user.name "Jan Strydom"` and `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`.
- Failed to add `docs/daily-log/day-1.md` because the file was missing. Created it in `docs\daily-log` using VS Code.

## Key Outputs
- Domain: [skrif.org or alternative, or "Pending"]
- Social Handles: [List @Skrif handles, or "Pending"]
- Discord: https://discord.gg/ctPxDGeB
- GitHub: [github.com/SkrifLang/skrif](https://github.com/SkrifLang/skrif)
- Installed: [e.g., Python 3.8+, SLY/Lark, Git, VS Code, or "Pending"]

## Alignment with Skrif’s Vision
Today’s tasks established Skrif’s foundation, setting up the repo, branding, and community channels to build a human-readable, versatile language to outshine Python by 2030. The Discord server, MIT License (under SkrifLang), and Git configuration lay the groundwork for collaboration and monetization.

## Time Spent
~2.5-3 hours (due to PowerShell directory issues, Git configuration, and file creation)
