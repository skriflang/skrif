# skrif Development Log: Day 2 (May 10, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Drafted initial skrif syntax for variables, functions, and web routes in docs/syntax-draft.md.
- Tested a simple lexer for variable declarations in src/lexer_test.py using SLY.
- Created GitHub Project board (skrif Development) with To Do, In Progress, Done columns.
- Documented progress in this log.
- Documenting `.skr` file extension for Skrif source code.


## Challenges and Solutions
- Encountered SLY lexer error due to incorrect regex, fixed by updating NAME pattern
- GitHub Project board permissions unclear, resolved via GitHub documentation
- Potential conflicts with niche .skr uses (e.g., PGP keyrings). Validated minimal overlap due to non-programming contexts (FileInfo.com).

## Key Outputs
- Syntax Draft: docs/syntax-draft.md
- Lexer Test: src/lexer_test.py
- Validated and secured `.skr` file extension for Skrif source code.
- Documented `.skr` availability in docs/setup/extension-validation.md.
- Defined `.skr` as the official extension in docs/specs/language.md.
- Updated README.md to guide developers to use `.skr` files.

- GitHub: [github.com/skriflang/skrif]

## Alignment with skrif’s Vision
Today’s tasks advanced skrif’s core design, defining a readable syntax to rival Python and setting up project tracking for community collaboration. The lexer test proves feasibility for compiling to JavaScript, supporting skrif’s initial web development focus.

## Time Spent
~2 hours
