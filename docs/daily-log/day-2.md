# skrif Development Log: Day 2 (May 10, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Drafted initial skrif syntax for variables, functions, and web routes in docs/syntax-draft.md.
- Tested a simple lexer for variable declarations in src/lexer_test.py using SLY.
- Created GitHub Project board (skrif Development) with To Do, In Progress, Done columns.
- Documented progress in this log.

## Challenges and Solutions
- [e.g., Lexer parsing errors, fixed by adjusting regex]
- [e.g., Project board setup confusion, resolved via GitHub docs]

## Key Outputs
- Syntax Draft: docs/syntax-draft.md
- Lexer Test: src/lexer_test.py
- Project Board: [https://github.com/users/skriflang/projects/1/views/1]
- GitHub: [github.com/skriflang/skrif](https://github.com/skriflang/skrif)

## Alignment with skrif’s Vision
Today’s tasks advanced skrif’s core design, defining a readable syntax to rival Python and setting up project tracking for community collaboration. The lexer test proves feasibility for compiling to JavaScript, supporting web development goals.

## Time Spent
~2 hours
