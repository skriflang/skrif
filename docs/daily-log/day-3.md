# skrif Development Log: Day 3 (May 11, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Expanded skrif syntax with conditionals and loops in docs/syntax-draft.md.
- Updated lexer in src/lexer_test.py to parse new tokens for conditionals and loops.
- Created basic parser in src/parser_test.py to validate conditional syntax.
- Documented progress in this log.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Fixed Project board 404 error by creating a public, repository-scoped board at github.com/skriflang/skrif/projects/1, replacing organization-scoped board after multiple attempts.
- Encountered 'No such file or directory' error in Git Bash when running python src/parser_test.py due to incorrect working directory (C:\Program Files\Git). Fixed by changing to project directory (C:\Users\JanStrydom\Projects\skrif) and confirming file paths.

## Key Outputs
- Syntax Draft: docs/syntax-draft.md
- Lexer: src/lexer_test.py
- Parser: src/parser_test.py
- Package: src/__init__.py
- Project Board: [https://github.com/skriflang/skrif/projects/9]
- GitHub: [https://github.com/skriflang/skrif]

## Alignment with skrif’s Vision
Today’s tasks enhanced skrif’s expressiveness with conditionals and loops, maintaining readability over Python. The parser validates syntax feasibility, advancing the compiler for JavaScript output and supporting skrif’s web development goals.
