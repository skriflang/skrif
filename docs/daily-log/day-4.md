# Skrif Development Log: Day 4 (May 13, 2025)

## Tasks Completed
- Expanded skrif syntax with arrays and objects in docs/syntax-draft.md.
- Updated lexer and parser in src/lexer_test.py and src/parser_test.py to handle arrays, achieving [('array', 'numbers', [1, 2, 3])].
- Initialized CHANGELOG.md to track skrif milestones.
- Documented progress in docs/weekly-log/week-1.md.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Regenerated __pycache__ files after parser testing, fixed by setting PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE permanently.
- Uncommitted docs/syntax-draft.md changes in VS Code, resolved by staging and committing.
