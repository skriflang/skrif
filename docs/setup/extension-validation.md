# .skr File Extension Validation

## Date
May 10, 2025

## Objective
Validate the availability of the `.skr` file extension for Skrif, an open-source programming language.

## Findings
- **Primary Uses**:
  - **PGP Private Keyring**: Used for private keys in PGP Desktop Home (secring.skr), a discontinued encryption tool. Low conflict risk due to non-programming context. [Source: FileInfo.com]
  - **Sekai Camera**: Location-based tags in an obsolete augmented reality app. Minimal overlap with programming. [Source: extensionfile.net]
  - **Autodesk Animation**: Screen key files, niche animation use. Unrelated to programming. [Source: extensionfile.net]
  - **Reflections/Monzoom Script**: Rare script format, low adoption. [Source: file.org]
  - **Microsoft ScriptIt**: Old command-line utility, limited modern use. [Source: solvusoft.com]
- **Availability**: `.skr` is rarely used in programming contexts, with no major conflicts identified. Its niche associations (encryption, AR, animation) do not overlap with Skrif’s programming language scope.
- **Recommendation**: Proceed with `.skr` as Skrif’s official file extension due to its availability and alignment with branding (short, memorable, unique).

## Next Steps
- Define `.skr` in language specification (docs/specs/language.md).
- Integrate with compiler and VS Code extension.
- Announce via skrif.org and @SkrifLang branding.
